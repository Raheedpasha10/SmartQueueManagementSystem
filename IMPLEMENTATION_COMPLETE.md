## 🎓 **TECHNICAL Q&A PREP**

**Q: How does the AI work?**
**A**: "We use Emergent AI's Claude Sonnet 4.5 model. It analyzes symptoms, vital signs, and patient history to recommend appropriate triage levels following medical protocols."

**Q: Where does hospital data come from?**
**A**: "We integrate with Google Places API to fetch real hospital information including locations, ratings, and contact details. This ensures accuracy and reliability."

**Q: Is this data real-time?**
**A**: "Yes, hospital data from Google is current. For demo efficiency, we cache it locally, but in production it can be refreshed regularly."

**Q: What about privacy/security?**
**A**: "All patient data is stored securely in Supabase with Row Level Security. AI analysis is done server-side. No PHI is sent to third parties unnecessarily."

**Q: Can this scale?**
**A**: "Absolutely. We use caching to minimize API costs, serverless functions for auto-scaling, and have fallback mechanisms for reliability."
